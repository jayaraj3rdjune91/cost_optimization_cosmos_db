Proposed Architecture: Tiered Storage Using Cosmos DB + Azure Blob Storage
Architecture Overview:
Hot Tier (Cosmos DB): Keep only recent records (e.g., last 3 months) in Cosmos DB.

Cold Tier (Blob Storage): Move older records (>3 months) to Azure Blob Storage in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

Data Access Layer / Smart Proxy: Introduce a lightweight abstraction in your existing service to transparently:

Query Cosmos DB first.

If not found, fallback to Blob Storage.

Seamlessly return the result without changing the API.

Cost Optimization:
Cosmos DB: You pay for RU/s, which scale with data size. Keeping only active records reduces costs.

Blob Storage: Much cheaper than Cosmos DB for storing large volumes of infrequently accessed data.

Implementation Steps (Zero Downtime & No API Changes):
1. Cold Storage Structure
Store old records as individual blobs or grouped by month/day in JSON files, using a naming convention like:

swift
Copy
Edit
/billing-archive/yyyy/mm/dd/<record-id>.json
Use Blob Index Tags to optimize lookup.

2. Data Migration (Background Process)
Write an Azure Function with Timer Trigger or Data Factory Pipeline:

Periodically query Cosmos DB for records older than 3 months.

Export them to Blob Storage.

Verify successful migration.

Delete from Cosmos DB after a safe retention buffer (e.g., 1 week after archive).

3. Smart Data Access Layer
In your read logic:

Try to fetch the record from Cosmos DB.

If not found (404), query Blob Storage.

Return result transparently.

No changes to your APIs are needed, only internal logic is enhanced.

4. Write Logic
All new writes still go to Cosmos DB. The cold tier is read-only.

Optional Enhancements:
Use Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management to auto-move rarely accessed data to cool/archive tiers.

Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently re-accessed cold records.

Add logging/monitoring to the fallback path for observability.
